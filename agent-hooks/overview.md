## Overview

`@sigilcore/agent-hooks` is the client-side enforcement layer for Sigil. It intercepts an agent's intended tool call **before** it executes, submits it to the Sigil Sign `/v1/authorize` endpoint, and blocks or holds the action based on the policy decision.

Without agent-hooks, Sigil Sign governs EVM transactions only. With agent-hooks, Sigil governs any agent action on any framework — bash commands, HTTP requests, file writes, wallet signing, and email sends.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @sigilcore/agent-hooks
```

## How It Works

Every tool call an agent attempts is intercepted before execution:

```
Agent attempts tool call
        ↓
@sigilcore/agent-hooks
        ↓
POST /v1/authorize → Sigil Sign
        ↓
Policy evaluated against warranty.md
        ↓
APPROVED → tool executes
DENIED   → typed rejection returned to agent
PENDING  → action held for human approval
```

## Supported Frameworks

| Framework | Adapter |
|---|---|
| Claude Code / Anthropic SDK | `checkAnthropicToolUse` |
| ELIZA | `checkElizaAction` |
| LangChain | `wrapLangChainTool` |
| Any framework | `checkIntent` (generic) |

## Governed Actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `bash` | Shell command execution |
| `web_fetch` | Outbound HTTP requests |
| `file_write` | Filesystem writes |
| `wallet_sign` | EVM wallet signing |
| `email.send` | Outbound email |
| `wallet.transfer` | EVM token transfers |
| `contract.call` | EVM contract calls |

## Prerequisites

You need a Sigil API key and a signed `warranty.md` policy file deployed to Sigil Sign.

- Get an API key: [sigilcore.com/tools/keys](https://sigilcore.com/tools/keys)
- Generate a policy: [sigilcore.com/tools/warrant](https://sigilcore.com/tools/warrant)

## Fail-Open Behavior

Network errors to the Sigil Sign API result in a **fail-open APPROVED** decision with a warn log. This is intentional — Sigil is a governance layer, not a kill switch. Agent workflows must not break when Sigil is temporarily unreachable.

Operators who require fail-closed behavior should handle the `onError` callback and implement their own circuit breaker.
